# SensorDrop

SensorDrop is an open-source system for remotely detaching individual animal-borne sensors from wildlife collars.

SensorDrop builds upon and extends the functionality of existing open-source full wildlife collar detachment mechanisms [1], and is the result of over 800 hours of additional development and field-testing time. 

# Repository structure

The SensorDrop repository is organised around design and schematics files needed for the development of SensorDrop units:

- For producing: contains all of the needed design files, schematics, and parts lists to independently manufacture SensorDrop units. 
- Supplemental information: contains information to help with key SensorDrop design choice considerations (e.g., potential pitfalls and lessons learnt in user deployments)

# Further information

A more detailed overview of SensorDrop and its use in wildlife science will be covered within a manuscript (currently under peer-review). 

A link to the manuscript will be provided upon its publication.
