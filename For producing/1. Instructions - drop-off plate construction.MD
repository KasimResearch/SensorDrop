## Components needed
- 3D printed plate x 1
- Acrylic plate x 1
- Brass spacer x 2

## Additional items needed
- Superglue
- Soldering iron
- Flat head screwdriver 
- Silicon sealant (optional)

## Instructions 
1. Using a small amount of superglue, glue the acrylic plate onto the end of the drop-off plate with the two holes carved to accommodate the brass spacer. To help line up the holes on the acrylic plate with the holes on the drop-off plate, two walls have been added to the drop-off plate. Placing the acrylic plate flush against these walls creates alignment with everything. Note that when you add the glue, ensure it does not contact the five holes where the nylon line will go through. 
2. Once the super glue has dried. Place a brass spacer in one of the two larger holes created for it. It won’t go fully into the space created for it, but that’s okay. Once the spacer is in the hole, heat your soldering iron. Carefully apply the soldering iron tip to the top of the brass spacer and gently press down. Be careful, as this will heat the brass spacer. As the brass spacer heats, it will slowly melt into the cavity created for it. Once the lip of the bottom of the brass spacer is level with the acrylic plate, remove the soldering iron. Apply a tiny amount of super glue to where the brass spacer and the acrylic plate meet so that the adhesive can seep into the cavity. Allow it to dry, and repeat the above steps with the other brass spacer.
3. OPTIONAL: if you want to waterproof the holes where the nylon line passes through, you can use silicon sealant (e.g., Technicqll Black High-Temperature Silicone Adhesive Sealant). To do this, flip the drop-off plate upside down and fill each of the holes with silicon sealant. A thin layer here is fine. You don’t want to fill it so much that the sealant goes entirely through to the other side of the plate. Allow it to dry for at least 48 hours (or however long the manufacturer recommends).
